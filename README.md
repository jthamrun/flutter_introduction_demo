# flutter_introduction_demo

This repository consists of the many pages that I created in order to introduce
Flutter to my students at Coding Minds Academy. The goal was for them to
understand that Flutter is a platform that they could use to start building their
applications on. They were also taught on how they could integrate Firebase with
Flutter for realtime database and authentication service.

The students were taught on:
- Basics of Dart
- UI Layouts (Columns, Rows)
- Basic Widgets
- Page Creation
- Navigation between pages
- Top down approach to design pages
- ListView, ListTile and Data basics
- State
- Firebase Integration
- Firebase Authentication for Login Page
- Realtime Database Integration (Write, Read, Update)
- Firebase Storage Integration
- Creation of a Basic Messaging App (Private and Group Chats)
- Picture Taking in Application using Flutter
